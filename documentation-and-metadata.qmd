# Data documentation {.unnumbered}

Clear and accurate documentation should be provided about the purpose, context and methodology of the research project and the data outputs. Good documentation helps make datasets findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable (FAIR principles). Documentation should include a detailed description of the dataset, providing information about structure, folders, files, variables and versioning. Information about definitions, variable names, problematic values, missing observations and weightings should be included. A concise note on methodology should be provided, along with information on how and when the data was collected or generated, and elaboration techniques (sub-setting, combining &c.). At the end of the research project, codebooks, questionnaires and data dictionaries should be reposited with the data.
