This 12^th^ edition of the EUI Library Research Data Guide provides
information and best practices about data discovery, data access, data
generation, data processing, data protection, data management planning,
data preservation and data sharing. Information in this guide helps
support EUI data users throughout their research projects and is
intended to raise awareness of how good research data management
contributes to the overall quality of scientific research.

\
1. DATA DISCOVERY AND THE EUI LIBRARY DATA PORTAL**

This section describes access to EUI licensed data resources; access to
restricted micro-socioeconomic data; terms and conditions of access and
use; access to data hosted by other institutions and resources for open
data discovery.\
\
[1.a The EUI Library Data Portal]{.underline}\
\
The Library maintains a Data Portal[^1] providing access to licensed
resources for EUI members and introducing selected open data resources
of relevance to EUI research themes. All 78 resources indexed in the
Data Portal have an online guide with (i) data description and scope
(ii) time-period coverage and release/wave information (iii) supporting
resources (online manuals, software transfer routines, user networks)
and (iv) terms and conditions of access and use. Modes of access for
each database are described in the individual resource guides linked
from the Data Portal. There are foursub-directories:

-   Macroeconomic, Financial and Historical Data Resources for national,
    regional and global economic, political and historical research[^2]

-   Micro-socioeconomic Data Resources for household, family, individual
    and company-level research[^3]

-   European, EU and Euro Area Data Resources providing statistics for
    research on pan-European topics, the European Union, European
    countries and European sub-state regions[^4]

-   

-   Data Topics Index for matching research themes with data
    resources.[^5]

Databases indexed in the EUI Library Data Portal have diverse modes of
access which are described on each resource page. The most common modes
of access are:

-   Proxied internet proxied internet access and authenticated internet
    access (mostly for macroeconomic, political economic and historical
    time series)

-   Library restricted data server (mostly for micro-socioeconomic
    resources)

-   Desktop application: eg. Datastream via Programmes, Compustat via
    Stata.

Macroeconomic data providers include Databanks, ECB, Eurostat, Global
Financial Data, IMF, OECD, Refinitiv-LSEG, Standard & Poor's, Statista
GmbH, World Bank, UN and WIIW.[^6]

[1.b Registration for access to Library-hosted micro-socioeconomic
data]{.underline}\
\
EUI members can register for access to micro data hosted by the EUI
Library as follows:

-   Complete the micro-socioeconomic data registration form (selecting
    the required dataset from the drop-down menu)[^7]

-   For some providers, parallel registration with data issuers is
    required

-   Registered users are given access to the Library's restricted data
    server

-   Specific instructions are provided under \'How to access\' on the
    individual micro data resource pages linked from the Data Portal[^8]

-   Short-term EUI visitors do not have access to EUI-hosted micro data.

[1.c Access to Eurostat micro-socioeconomic data]{.underline}\
\
The EUI is a Eurostat-approved research data facility. Access to
Eurostat collated data (EU Adult Education Survey, EU Labour Force
Survey, EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions and European
Community Household Panel) requires individual end-user contracts with
Eurostat. Consult the resource pages in the Data Portal for access
instructions.[^9]

No person(s) other than those named in the Eurostat contract can access
the data. Breach of contract conditions may lead to the withdrawal of
the EUI\'s research entity recognition, and the loss of access to
Eurostat micro data by other EUI scholars. There is no off-campus access
to Eurostat micro data. Short-term visitors to the EUI do not have
access to Eurostat micro data. At the end of the project contract
period, Eurostat will contact the P.I. requesting a signed confirmation
of destruction of local copies/sub-sets of the data (Section 5.e below).
Publications based on the data should be reported via the Eurostat
online form.[^10]\
\
[1.d Terms and conditions of use and database copyright*\
*]{.underline}\
Access to, and use of, databases provided by the EUI Library are subject
to contractual license agreements and database copyright terms. Full
details are on the Library's Terms and Conditions' web page.[^11] Data
users are individually responsible for compliance with terms and
conditions of access and use. Violation of license terms puts at risk
other EUI members' future access to data resources and may expose the
university to financial penalties. EUI users may not distribute, or
allow any other party to have access to data which is provided under
license. Users may not use licensed materials for commercial purposes.
In some cases, the sharing of micro-socioeconomic data with journal
referees is not permitted (check individual data contracts for
details).\
\
[1.e Annual call for EUI early stage researcher funding applications\
]{.underline}\
The EUI Dean of Research issues an annual call for early stage
researcher (ESR) funding support. EUI researchers and fellows can apply
for financial support to cover some, or all, of the costs incurred in
data collection and data generation (surveys, interviews, fieldwork,
experiments &c.). ESRs should check the funding opportunities intranet
page under \'Internal (EUI) funding opportunities\'[^12] for the text of
the call, application form, FAQs and updated deadline.

-   Before the deadline of the ESR call, applicants are encouraged to
    complete the online CITI[^13] training module \'Essentials of Grant
    Proposal Development\' and (for empirical projects dealing with
    human-subject non-secondary data) \'GDPR for Research and Higher
    Ed\'.

-   Some projects may require EUI Ethics Committee approval (Section 2.b
    below). ESR call applicants may request Ethics Committee approval
    after the funding decision, but before the commencement of data
    collection and processing. Approval cannot be granted retroactively.

-   ESR applicants who are applying for data funding should first check
    the Library Data Portal for availability. If the required data is
    not available, write to both DPR@eui.eu and resdata@eui.eu asking
    whether the Library can contribute to the cost of data acquisition.

-   The reply of the Library Director should be included in the ESR
    funding application.

-   Academic units rank the proposals and a Selection Committee decides
    on financial support.

The ESR funding application form and full details are provided to all
EUI researchers and fellows by email at the launch of the call.\
\
[1.f Access to data at other institutions and open data
resources]{.underline}\
\
EUI members who require access to restricted data at another institution
(data centre, statistics agency, university, archive) should apply for
access early in their research projects because application periods can
be lengthy. Some sociological, qualitative and micro geo-coded data can
only be accessed at issuers' secure on-site facilities. EUI members who
require access to unpublished datasets (eg. underlying data associated
with a publication) should contact the Library before writing to data
creators/owners. In some instances, it may be possible for EUI members
to obtain access via library consortia. Scholars, government agencies
and international organisations increasingly share data, codebooks and
software via the internet. Open research datasets can be located via
Google Dataset Search[^14] and the re3data[^15] registry of research
data repositories which is indexed by discipline, sub-discipline, data
type and host institution.\
\
**\
2. DATA GENERATION, DATA PROTECTION, DATA PROCESSING AND ETHICAL USE**\
\
This section provides information on data protection requirements for
scholars who generate and process sensitive data; the EUI Ethics
Committee review procedure; anonymisation and pseudonymisation
techniques and the Library Secure Data Room.\
\
[\
2.a Data protection\
]{.underline}\
Data Protection at the EUI is governed by President's Decision
No.10/2019[^16] which was introduced following the adoption of the EU
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).[^17] The EUI 'Guide to Good
Data Protection Practice in Research' provides detailed information
about data protection at the EUI.[^18] Special terms and conditions
apply to access and use of personal data, including micro-socioeconomic
and qualitative data. This reflects the sensitive nature of observations
about human subjects, families and households. Data protection
provisions apply to (i) personal data generated by scholars for research
purposes (ii) licensed micro-socioeconomic data provided to EUI members
by the Library and (iii) data provided directly to EUI members under
third-party contract.\
\
EUI principal investigators are responsible for compliance with the laws
and regulations governing data protection and database copyright.
Scholars are subject to personal data protection regulations when
generating, processing, collecting and storing personal data.[^19] When
using pre-existing datasets, scholars must not attempt to identify any
person, family or household. When generating new data (eg. surveys)
scholars must adhere to data protection legislation and best practices.
The processing of sensitive data relating to health, racial/ethnic
origin, religious beliefs, political opinions, genetic/biometric
observations, sexual orientation, memberships &c. requires strict
safeguards.[^20] The EUI 'Guide to Good Data Protection Practice in
Research' states: "As a rule, the processing of sensitive data is
prohibited. However, Article 8 of the EUI's Data Protection Policy
provides for specific circumstances which allow for the processing of
sensitive data. The most common in research is upon the data subject's
explicit consent."[^21] Persons, families and households cannot be
identifiable in any subsequently published research dataset. It must not
be possible to identify human subjects by combining observations with
external sources or other means. Anonymisation and pseudonymisation are
described in Section 2.d below.\
\
When collecting, processing, using and storing personal data; scholars
are responsible for obtaining and documenting the informed consent of
subjects. Any and every collecting, processing, storing and future
sharing of data related to human subjects requires consent. These
aspects must be foreseen and explicitly stated in the consent form.
Consent must be intelligible; it should refer clearly and precisely to
the scope and the consequences of the data processing, as well as the
retention period. EUI scholars can use the sample consent form.[^22]
Where written consent is not possible, audio or video recording may be
used. Human subjects must be informed of their rights, and scholars
should consider risks to data subjects before embarking on personal data
gathering via interviews, questionnaires or other means.\
\
[2.b EUI Ethics Committee review: processing and use of sensitive data\
\
]{.underline}The collection and processing of personal data for research
purposes may require EUI scholars to apply for Ethics Committee review
before data collection and processing can begin. Principal investigators
should consult the online Initial Checklist on the Ethics Committee
homepage.[^23] EUI members can initiate the review via the link
\'Procedure to request an Ethics Review\' (intranet login required). The
Ethics Committee review must be completed before data collection
begins - approval cannot be granted retroactively. The review can take
up to six weeks.

EUI members have access to the online Collaborative Institutional
Training Initiative (CITI) platform, providing training on research
ethics including: Human subjects research; Responsible conduct of
research; Observational research protocols; General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) for research, and Essentials of grant proposal
development. EUI members can create a CITI account (username and
password) via the EUI intranet (login required)[^24] selecting 'European
University Institute' from the drop-down menu.

EUI members requiring access to the survey tool Qualtrics[^25] should
write to the HelpDesk[^26] to request an individual account. Users
should read the EUI Declaration on the Processing of Data via
Surveys[^27] before collecting personal information.

[2.c Information Security Risk Assessment]{.underline}

EUI scholars and principal investigators who require ICT Service
approval for information security should complete the Information Risk
Management Questionnaire[^28] and send it to the Data Security Officer
(DSO) at: data_security_officer@eui.eu Information Security Guidelines
regarding compliance with data protection requirements, and the
checklist of security controls, are provided on the EUI intranet.[^29]
The information will be used by the DSO to assess the project risk level
and to provide advice on the adequate safeguards to implement.\
\
[2.d Anonymisation and pseudonymisation\
]{.underline}\
Throughout the research data cycle, scholars are responsible for
preserving the confidentiality of human subjects, families and
households. Sensitive data must be anonymised so that persons, families
and households cannot be directly or indirectly identifiable.
Anonymisation techniques include; the removal of direct identifiers from
datasets (names, workplaces, telephone numbers &c.); the aggregation,
banding or reduction of the precision of variables (eg: year of birth
rather than year/month/date of birth); the reporting of general levels
of observation (eg. replacing specific geo-codes with general
locations); the generalisation of categories (eg. sector of employment
rather than precise employment function); and the removal of the upper
or lower ranges of observations.[^30]\
\
Pseudonomysiation can be used when it is necessary to retain personal
data for future processing (eg. a follow-up survey). Pseudonomysiation
entails the substitution of personal information with a unique
identifier not connected to the person's real identity, using unique,
randomly-generated, numeric or alphanumeric identifiers. The data and
the key file must be kept separate and secure at all times.
Pseudonymised data must be treated as personal data in accordance with
GDPR.[^31] The use of cloud computing services must not reduce the level
of data protection. Data can be encrypted with a tool such as
TrueCrypt.[^32]\
\
[2.e Library Secure Data Room and security protocols\
\
]{.underline}The EUI Secure Data Room is located on the upper floor of
the Library, Badia Fiesolana (BF-173). The Room is only accessible to
scholars processing sensitive data, or using data from providers whose
contracts explicitly require that data be used in a locked room. The
room is not for 'general' data access and use. New EUI data users who
require access to the Secure Data Room should send a copy of their data
access contracts to resdata@eui.eu. Authorised users can book a computer
(Monday to Saturday) via the Library's online form.[^33] Workspaces #1,
#2 or #6 can be used on a first-come first-served basis. Workspaces #3
and #4 are reserved for specific datasets. Workspace #5 can be utilized
for authorised laptop use.To access the Secure Data Room, scholars
should enter the Library via the Badia loggia, and show their EUI card
at the Library Loan Desk where the key will be issued. The key must be
returned to the Loan Desk at the end of the working session.\
\
[2.f Third-party data access\
]{.underline}\
Many third-party data providers require individual end-user contracts.
In cases where the signature of an 'authorised representative' is
required, scholars should write to the office of the Legal Advisor in
the Central Coordination Unit.[^34] The Library provides support for
data access applications, contract workflow and data management. Send
the following information to resdata@eui.eu:

-   Name of data issuer/publisher

-   Title of dataset, with internet URL (if available)

-   Names of EUI and external research team members, with email contacts

-   What special conditions are required for access to the data (eg.
    remote protocol)?

-   What special conditions are required for use of the data?

-   Does the data issuer require a contract counter-signature from the
    EUI DPO?

Does the data issuer require that the data be used in the EUI's Secure
Data Room?

-   Does the data issuer require that the data be used on a stand-alone,
    off-line computer?

-   For projects with non-EUI collaborators: What controller/processing
    operations will be undertaken by research partners?

Data provided by third parties can be elaborated on a provider's
infrastructure or (where permitted) can be transferred to the EUI. When
sensitive personal data is transferred to the EUI, users have to
complete the EUI 'Notification of Processing Operations' form, available
from the office of the EUI Legal Advisor.[^35] In cases of joint
research collaborations between EUI members and scholars at other
institutions (eg. in the context of research consortia) it is important
to distinguish between the 'data controller' function and the 'data
processor' function - and to indicate the division of labour between
scholars - especially where research team members are based at different
institutions. The General Data Protection Regulation distinguishes
between 'data controller' (eg. principal investigator or head of
department) and 'data processor' (eg. PhD researcher). The GDPR defines
'controller' as a "natural or legal person, public authority, agency or
other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes
and means of the processing of personal data" (Article 4(7)). The GDPR
defines 'processor' as a "natural or legal person, public authority,
agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the
controller" (Article 4(8)).[^36] If required by the data issuer, the EUI
ICT Data Security Officer can provide a description of ICT security
protocols and infrastructure.[^37]

**\
3. DATA MANAGEMENT PLANS\
**

Data management plans (DMPs) are documents normally required by research
funders at the beginning, mid-point and end of research projects. Early
stage researchers should learn how to create DMPs, required when
applying for future project funding.

[3.a Generating a data management plan (DMP)]{.underline}

The principal investigator, or project manager, or delegated member of
the research team, is responsible for writing and delivering the data
management plan. The following supporting materials should be consulted
during the preparation of EUI DMPs:

-   EUI 'Guide to Good Data Protection Practice in Research'[^38]

-   EUI Guidelines on Ethics and Integrity in Academic Research[^39]

-   EUI Library 'Research Data Guide' \[this document, also online with
    hyperlinks\].[^40]

Scholars preparing a data management plan should carefully follow the
instructions provided by the relevant science programme office (eg.
Horizon Europe, European Research Council &c.). Where a DMP template is
provided, this must be used; for example: the Horizon Europe DMP
template[^41] in the Horizon Europe Programme[^42] or the ERC DMP
template[^43] in the ERC Work Programme.[^44]

The sections below provide advice and prompts which can be used when
preparing a data management plan. Every data management plan is a unique
document, grounded in the individual research project. It is the
responsibility of the P.I. (or delegated team member) to write and
deliver a comprehensive, accurate and original data management plan. The
Library provides feedback and guidance. Data management plans describe:

-   How data is collected and generated

-   How data is used, elaborated and organised

-   How data, and data subjects, are protected

-   How data, code and ancillary elements are described and documented

-   How data is stored and secured during the project, and how long it
    will be retained

-   How dataset authorship and credit are assigned

-   How data is preserved

-   How, whether and under what terms, research data outputs can be
    shared.

The FAIR data principles - to make data findable, accessible,
interoperable and reusable[^45] - must be considered during the
preparation and revision of data management plans. Detailed information
about these four principles are in the grid below.\
\
For international collaborative projects, the name of the person who has
final authority regarding credit for dataset creation, and the sharing
of data outputs, should be indicated. Unless otherwise stated, the P.I.
undertakes this role. It is important to update DMPs throughout the
research project, incorporating new information about data collection,
data generation, methodologies and relevant changes to the composition
of the research team or consortium.

[3.b EUI support for principal investigators and project
managers]{.underline}

**\
**EUI principal investigators and Project Managers can use the general
prompts in the grid below when compiling a data management plan. Where
the science funder provides a DMP template, this should be used. The
data management plan must include detailed, project-specific information
before submission to the science funder. During preparation of the DMP,
EUI members may need to liaise with Library staff, the Data Protection
Officer, the Data Security Officer and/or the Ethics Committee (if
approval is required). The following elements should be provided in a
data management plan:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

[3.c Data management planning tools]{.underline}

Online tools can be used to prepare structured data management plans -
complying with EU Horizon Europe, European Research Council, and other
science funder DMP requirements.

-   **DMPonline**[^53] (maintained by the Digital Curation Centre) can
    be accessed via 'Create Account' at the upper right of the DMPonline
    homepage. For organisation enter 'other'. Select the science
    funder\'s template. The principal investigator (P.I.) should be
    identified in the data management plan. For research teams, the P.I.
    can assign DMP sharing rights by entering colleagues' email
    addresses and assigning the status of 'co-owner', 'editor' or 'read
    only.' Enter project details (title, abstract, &c.) and click on
    'Initial DMP' in the top menu. Complete the sub-fields to generate
    the data management plan. A Word document can be generated. If the
    science funder provides a DMP template, the text generated in
    DMPonline can be transferred into the funder\'s template.

-   **The Research Data Management Organiser** (RDMO)[^54] is an online
    tool available in German and English to support research data
    management. RDMO is maintained by the Deutsche
    Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).

-   **Argos**[^55] is an online DMP creation tool maintained by
    OpenAIRE. Create an account on the Argos platform, click 'Launch
    Wizard' and follow the step-by-step instructions.

-   **The DMP Evaluation Rubric**[^56] developed by Science Europe,
    provides core criteria which can be used by principal investigators
    and project managers to evaluate data management plans.

-   **FAIRsharing** is a data support service of the Data Readiness
    Group and the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford, providing
    resources for data and metadata standards and research data
    management.[^57]

-   **The F**-**UJI Automated Fair Data Assessment Tool**[^58]
    maintained by the Fostering FAIR Data Practices In Europe project,
    helps scholars comply with the FAIR Guiding Principles for
    scientific data management that ensure data are - and remain -
    findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR).

-   **FAIR**-**Aware**[^59] maintained by the Data Archiving and
    Networked Services Institute is an online checklist tool to help
    researchers build compliance with the FAIR data principles.

-   **The DMP Catalogue**[^60] maintained by LIBER, provides examples of
    research data management plans.

**4. RESEARCH DATA MANAGEMENT IN HORIZON EUROPE, ERC AND OTHER EU
PROGRAMMES**

EUI principal investigators and project managers who are preparing EU
Horizon Europe and European Research Council (ERC) grant proposals are
required to submit preliminary information about data management
provisions. The Horizon Europe Programme Guide[^61] and the ERC Work
Programme[^62] provide guidance for project proposers.

Data management sections of project proposals are evaluated by the
European Commission under the criterion 'impact', which includes
scientific and societal benefit. When completing the general information
section of EU funding applications, scholars should address: (i) What
types of data will the project generate/collect? (ii) What standards
will be used? (iii) How will the data be exploited and/or shared for
verification and re-use? (iv) If data outputs cannot be made available,
explain why (v) How will the data be curated and preserved? The EUI
Library assists principal investigators and project managers with the
data management sections of funding proposals and the subsequent data
management plans (Section 3 above).[^63]\
\
Open Science is defined by the European Commission as "an approach to
the scientific process that focuses on spreading knowledge as soon as it
is available using digital and collaborative technology\... Open science
is a policy priority for the European Commission and the standard method
of working under its research and innovation funding programmes as it
improves the quality, efficiency and responsiveness of research. When
researchers share knowledge and data as early as possible in the
research process with all relevant actors it helps diffuse the latest
knowledge."[^64]\
\
In the Horizon Europe programme, open science - which includes open
access to research data - is evaluated under the 'excellence' criterion.
The European Commission's recommendation for sharing research data
outputs is: "As open as possible; as closed as necessary".[^65] The
Horizon Europe programme requires grant beneficiaries to reposit open
research data outputs in a research repository. The EUI research
repository, Cadmus, can be used for the reposit of EUI Horizon Europe
and ERC project data outputs. The EC guidelines state that "as far as
possible, projects must then take measures to enable third parties to
access, mine, exploit, reproduce and disseminate (free of charge for any
user) this research data. One way of doing this is to attach Creative
Commons Licences (CC BY or CC0) to the data reposited."[^66] Project
results can also be shared via the Horizon Results Platform.[^67]\
\
The European Open Science Cloud portal was launched in 2018.[^68] The
EOSC portal enables the discovery of tools and resources for data
analysis, and information about storage, computation, training and
security. The European Commission provides two supporting guides:
Prompting EOSC in Practice[^69] which explains the governance of the
service and Turning FAIR into Reality[^70] which explains how to make
research data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. The
European University Institute endorsed the European Open Science Cloud
Declaration in 2017. The Social Sciences & Humanities Open Marketplace
was launched in 2022 to provide "tools, services, training materials,
datasets, publications and workflows" for researchers.[^71]
Institutional partners are coordinated by the Consortium of European
Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA).[^72]

**5. MANAGING DATA DURING THE RESEARCH PROJECT CYCLE**

**\
**Data should be carefully managed throughout the duration of the
research project. Particular attention should be given to data input,
quality control, dataset design, data protection, data security and
backup during the project. At an early stage, scholars should define
dataset structure, file structure and variable naming. Documentation and
codebooks should be updated throughout the research project. The
following guides are useful for scholars working in the social sciences
and humanities:

-   CESSDA Data Management Expert Guide[^73]

-   JISC Research Data Management Toolkit[^74]

-   Finnish Social Science Data Archive Guide[^75]

-   UKDS Prepare and Manage Data Guide.[^76]

[5.a Data input and quality control]{.underline}

The collection and generation of data should be informed by high
standards of quality control. Datasets generated from fieldwork must be
accurate, complete and consistent - and must adhere to data protection
legislation and the ethical best-practices of the discipline or
sub-discipline. During the research project, scholars should keep an
accurate record of data inputs and data generation. Scholars undertaking
surveys and experiments should ensure that anonymisation techniques are
documented. Where research datasets are partially based on pre-existing
resources, scholars should ensure that the underlying sources are of
high quality and that there are no infringements of copyright.

Scholars must comply with the data protection requirements described in
Section 2 above. Sensitive data must be anonymised so that no persons,
families or households can be directly or indirectly identified in any
research data outputs. In those cases where it may be necessary to
retain personal data for future research use, scholars may use
pseudonymisation techniques (Section 2.d above). Scholars must comply
with any end-of-project data destruction requirements indicated by
providers (Section 5.e below).

[5.b Secure storage and network backup during the research
project]{.underline}

[\
]{.underline}During research projects it is important to keep data
secure at all times. The EUI ICT Service maintains a strong password
policy to prevent the loss, exposure, or corruption of sensitive
information.[^77] The ICT Service advises that the personal G:\\ network
drive "should always be used to store work-related data."[^78] The drive
is backed up by the ICT Service. Full details about EUI drive quotas are
provided by the ICT Service.[^79] (EUI members also have a personal C:\\
drive for storing non-work related data (photos &c.) which is not backed
up.) The EUI protects computing devices by applying patches, and
computers are protected by anti-malware solutions which are updated
regularly to prevent malware infections.

[5.c Structure, folders, files, variables, format and
versioning]{.underline}

The design of research datasets should be carefully considered at the
outset of the project. Dataset design varies by discipline, types of
data and variables, medium of data, units of analysis, methodology,
relationship between data elements, and whether or not the dataset is
part of a series. Clear and consistent metadata for folders, files,
variables and versioning helps make research data findable, accessible,
interoperable and re-usable (FAIR principles).[^80]

The folder structure of research datasets (eg. hierarchical /
horizontal) should be considered early in the project. Qualitative
datasets containing text, interviews, images &c. may require individual
files for every element. File names should be standardised and
consistent, eg: date, descriptor, version. Variables, such as age,
country and sex should be clearly tagged, avoiding special characters
and spaces. Temporary identifiers should be removed from the schema.
Files should be systematically named using a standardised and consistent
versioning system, eg. YYYY-MM-DD. Changes to the structure should be
documented. Versioning systems can be used to track changes to data and
code, eg. the GIT (global information tracker) version control
resource.[^81]

The software format of the dataset should facilitate flexible use of the
data. Scholars using one format during a research project, may consider
a different format for preservation - taking into consideration open
source accessibility. To avoid future file obsolescence, it is best to
avoid proprietary formats, where possible. For example .rtf instead of
.doc/.docx; .tif instead of .jpg; .flac instead of .mp3 &c. Details of
how to submit dataset outputs to the EUI research repository, Cadmus,
are in Section 6 below.

[5.d Documentation and codebooks]{.underline}

Clear and accurate documentation should be provided about the purpose,
context and methodology of the research project and the data outputs.
Good documentation helps make datasets findable, accessible,
interoperable and re-usable (FAIR principles). Documentation should
include a detailed description of the dataset, providing information
about structure, folders, files, variables and versioning. Information
about definitions, variable names, problematic values, missing
observations and weightings should be included. A concise note on
methodology should be provided, along with information on how and when
the data was collected or generated, and elaboration techniques
(sub-setting, combining &c.). At the end of the research project,
codebooks, questionnaires and data dictionaries should be reposited with
the data.

[5.e Deletion of sensitive data at the end of the research
project]{.underline}\
\
At the end of a research project, it may be necessary to permanently
delete data used in the elaboration phase. Many micro-socioeconomic data
providers (eg. Eurostat) require deletion of work-files and
non-aggregate outputs. EUI members can use software such as Disk
Wipe[^82] which performs byte-by-byte deletion of data, ensuring that
data cannot be retrieved. If the provider of the underlying data
requires a compliance statement, the name of the software used, the
location of the device, the name of the drive and the time of deletion
should be recorded. Contact the EUI ICT Service[^83] for assistance with
deletion software, and the Library for further information about
compliance.[^84]

**6. REPOSITING AND PRESERVING DATA IN THE EUI RESEARCH REPOSITORY
CADMUS**

EUI research data can be preserved in the research repository, Cadmus,
which is an infrastructure for EUI research outputs, a platform
for sharing research data and a solution for funder-mandated research
data management compliance.[^85] Scholars are encouraged to reposit
and - where possible - to share data in compliance with the European
Commission's policy on Open Science to spread knowledge "as soon as it
is available using digital and collaborative technology."[^86] Special
provisions for the preservation and sharing of qualitative data (audio,
transcripts &c.) are described in Section 8 below.\
\
[6.a Preparing data for reposit in Cadmus]{.underline}

Datasets presented for reposit in the EUI research repository, Cadmus,
must be compliant with data protection regulations pertaining to
persons, families and households. Research datasets which are partially
based on pre-existing sources must not violate database copyright
provisions. Library staff can advise on compliance. The European
Commission published a report on Open Science and Intellectual Property
Rights in 2022.[^87] EUI members submitting to the Cadmus repository
should create a DATA folder and a DOCS folder. The DOCS folder should
contain precise documentation about the methodology, context and
discipline of the research project. Where applicable, codebooks should
also be presented for reposit. Documentation should be in PDF/a format
for preservation. Data should be submitted in the original file format.
Large datasets should be submitted in a compressed archival format (eg.
.zip, .tgz). Subsets should be accommodated within the DATA folder - not
submitted as multiple repository entries. If new iterations of a dataset
are planned, scholars can consult with Library staff to determine
whether these should be added to the original Cadmus entry (with updated
date range), or reposited as a new Cadmus entry. The uploading of
datasets and documentation is done by Library staff after the submission
of the online submission form. The archiving of more restricted
qualitative multi-media outputs (audio, transcripts &c.) is described in
Section 8 below.

[6.b Completing the dataset submission form\
]{.underline}\
EUI researchers, fellows and professors, from any discipline, can submit
research data outputs for reposit in the Cadmus repository. Datasets
presented for inclusion must be the output of research by either (i) a
current EUI member or (ii) an EUI research team or (iii) a team of
scholars with at least one EUI member. The first step is to complete the
online submission form.[^88] Library staff will use the submitted
information to generate a formal metadata description in the Dublin Core
schema which will be used to generate the description page for the
dataset in Cadmus. This process helps render the data findable,
accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR Principles). Library staff
will then make an appointment for data transfer. The name of the
principal investigator, researcher(s), and - where appropriate -
technical collaborator(s), must be provided. The email contacts of all
collaborators must be provided. If the project is undertaken in the
context of a consortium, the name of the data manager should be provided
(if different from the principal investigator).

By submitting the online data submission form, the P.I. acknowledges
that the dataset presented for inclusion in the Cadmus repository is the
output of original data generation and/or collection; or the output of
significant, value-added elaboration of pre-existing sources. If the
dataset is the output of original data collection and elaboration,
details must be provided. If the dataset is derived from pre-existing
sources, these sources must be listed (publisher, rights owner and/or
institutional source). Creators of research data outputs which have been
elaborated from pre-existing copyrighted sources may need to obtain the
permission of rights owners before research data outputs can be openly
shared. Write to the Library for assistance. It is not possible to
publish a dataset containing substantial portions of data sourced from
pre-existing databases governed by contractual license. Scholars can
also reposit datasets in the discipline-specific data repositories
indexed in the international re3data registry[^89] and by Google Dataset
Search.[^90]

EUI members submitting data to the Cadmus repository should state
whether or not the dataset can be shared as open data or will be subject
to embargo. Library staff can assist. In some cases it may be possible
to create a limited, or aggregated, public version of the dataset for
open sharing. Embargo status can change over time.

[6.c Metadata]{.underline}

Metadata are 'data about data' presented in a formal schema. Accurate
metadata are necessary for the organisation, use, repositing, sharing
and machine-discovery of datasets. Throughout the research cycle, it is
important to keep a detailed and updated record of data capture,
generation and elaboration. An introduction to metadata standards for
social science and humanities' data is maintained by the Digital
Curation Centre.[^91] Metadata should be consistent throughout the
research project. Some research data outputs may require multi-lingual
metadata. EUI Cadmus metadata are generated by Library staff, using
information from the online submission form.[^92] These are the
principal fields:

[NAME(S) OF DATASET CREATOR(S)]{.underline}

The name, or names, of the scholars and (where applicable) technical
collaborators who created the dataset must be provided. The name of the
principal investigator must be given if the dataset has been created by
a research team. If the project is undertaken in the context of a
consortium, the name of the data manager must be provided (if different
from the P.I.). Where researcher IDs are available (eg. ORCID) these
should be provided.

[EMAIL CONTACT(S)]{.underline}

The email contacts of the dataset creator(s) must be provided. Datasets
presented for inclusion in the EUI Cadmus repository must be the output
of research by a current EUI member, or an EUI research team, or a team
of researchers with at least one EUI member.

[TITLE OF DATASET]{.underline}\
The title should precisely convey the nature and scope of the dataset.
The title should not be identical to the project title, or a related
publication title.

variable descriptions should be provided.

[FUNDING STATEMENT]{.underline}

The name of funding bodies and research grant numbers should be
provided, where applicable.

[RELATED PUBLICATIONS]{.underline}

Bibliographical details of publications based on the dataset, if any,
should be listed with links to abstracts and, where possible,
full-texts. (The Library can also cross-index publications and datasets
after reposit.)

[PROJECTED FUTURE WAVES OF DATASET]{.underline}\
In cases where it is intended to generate future iterations of the
dataset, details should be provided.

[DATASET CITATION]{.underline}\
The Cadmus repository generates standardised citations for datasets,
eg:\
RAUDE, Marie, MAZZARANO, Matteo, EU Emissions Trading System sectoral
environmental and economic indicators, EUI, RSC, Research Data, 2024 -
https://hdl.handle.net/1814/76817

When submitting details of research publications to the EUI Cadmus
repository, EUI scholars should cite datasets which support the research
findings.[^95] Further information about data citation is provided by
DataCite.[^96]

[6.d Linking datasets and publications]{.underline}\
\
Datasets reposited in Cadmus can be linked to related publications. EUI
members should provide details of publications when submitting related
datasets. Subsequent publications can also be cross-linked in Cadmus.

**\
\
7. OPEN DATA FAIR PRINCIPLES AND OPEN SCIENCE**

[7.a Data repositories and Library support]{.underline}\
\
Scholars, government agencies and international organisations
increasingly share datasets, codebooks and software via the internet.
Major data repositories are indexed in the international re3data
registry[^97] and Google Dataset Search.[^98] The EUI Library provides
comprehensive support for open access publishing and open science.[^99]
Since 2021 the EUI has an internal network of data liaisons, composed of
one academic and one administrative member for each academic unit. The
Dean of Research Office and the Legal Officer are observers. Data
liaisons meet for discussion on best practices related to research data
once or twice per year.

[7.b Data metadata and access rights]{.underline}

Accurate dataset metadata help scholars determine whether, when, how,
where and under what terms, research data outputs can be shared as open
data. Not all research data outputs can be openly shared at the
conclusion of a research project. The two most important considerations
when determining whether a research dataset can be made openly available
are: the protection of data pertaining to human subjects (Section 2.a)
and database copyright (Section 1.d). Library staff can help EUI members
determine whether and when a dataset can be openly shared. Data access
status may change over time. Data can be made openly available on
reposit; data can be embargoed for a defined period; data can be
restricted to on-site (\'safe room\') access; data can be subject to
pre-access registration terms (eg. access permission from data owner);
or data can be subject to user contract (sometimes requiring a project
proposal). In cases where underlying data observations cannot be shared,
it may be possible to create a limited or aggregated public version.
Data can also be reposited solely for preservation purposes ('dark
archive').

[7.c FAIR data principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable]{.underline}\
\
The FAIR data principles - to make data findable, accessible,
interoperable and reusable - provide a framework for good data
management practice.[^100] Section 3.b above provides information on how
to use the FAIR principles when preparing a data management plan. To
make data **findable**, datasets should be assigned accurate and
consistent metadata; the location of the data should be indicated; the
dataset should be clearly structured; and the dataset should have a
unique and persistent identifier. Datasets should be **accessible** ("as
open as possible, as closed as necessary"). The access status eg. 'open'
(accessible immediately) or 'embargoed' (accessible at a later date)
should be indicated. Data anonymisation and protection measures should
be described. Software and tools required to use the data should be
indicated. To make data **interoperable**, standard metadata and naming
systems should be used; controlled vocabularies or discipline-specific
taxonomies should be explained; variables and other elements should be
readable by standard software. To make data **reusable**, an open
license should be assigned; either the Creative Commons Attribution
International license: CC-BY International or the Creative Commons
Public Domain Universal license: CC0; Supporting documentation and
codebooks should be reposited with the data to make the observations
reusable by other scholars, and information about tools or instruments
necessary to reuse the data should be provided.

[7.d Pre-registration research plans]{.underline}

Scholars may pre-register research plans before substantive work on the
project commences.[^101] The Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the
Social Sciences provides resources for research data openness and
reproducibility.[^102] The GitHub hosting service (a subsidiary of
Microsoft Corp.) provides resources for software development, version
control and code hosting and sharing.[^103]

**8. QUALITATIVE AND UNSTRUCTURED DATA IN THE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL
SCIENCES**

This section treats qualitative data generation, use, preservation and
access in the humanities and social sciences. Examples of qualitative
data include; audio and audio-visual interviews, transcripts, images,
minable text, survey diaries, field notes and multimedia materials. The
definition of 'data' is broad, as it varies across academic disciplines
(eg. history, ethnography, anthropology, sociology &c.). Data collection
methodology, dataset structure and data documentation should conform to
the best practices of the discipline in which the research is
undertaken.[^104]

[8.a Protection and ethical use of qualitative data]{.underline}

Scholars generating, accessing, processing and sharing qualitative data
should pay particular attention to the data protection and ethical use
provisions described in the EUI 'Guide to Good Data Protection Practice
in Research'.[^105] Scholars are subject to data protection legislation
when collecting, generating, processing, using and storing personal
data. The processing of sensitive data relating to health, racial/ethnic
origin, religious beliefs, political opinions, genetic/biometric
observations, sexual orientation, memberships &c. may require EUI Ethics
Committee clearance before data collection and processing begins.[^106]
Ethics Committee approval cannot be sought retroactively. The Ethics
Committee review can take up to six weeks. Principal investigators
should consult the online Initial Checklist and the supporting
documentation on the EUI information page for Ethics and Integrity in
Academic Research.[^107] When collecting, processing, using and storing
personal data, scholars are responsible for obtaining and documenting
the informed consent of subjects. The EUI sample consent form can be
used.[^108] Throughout the research data lifecycle, scholars are
responsible for preserving the confidentiality of data observations
pertaining to human subjects, families and households. Anonymisation and
pseudonymisation techniques are described at Section 2.d above. Software
such as the open source QualiAnon anonymisation tool can be used for the
anonymisation and redaction of interview transcripts.[^109]

Scholars who intend to generate images, videos or photocopies of
materials and objects in museums and archives, should seek the rights
owners' permission in advance. Scholars who wish to reproduce
pre-existing images or multimedia of such materials (eg. photographs in
catalogues raisonne) should seek copyright clearance before reproducing.

[8.b Support, software and infrastructure for qualitative
data]{.underline}\
\
Support for qualitative data use and elaboration is provided by the EUI
Library. Software support is provided by the EUI ICT Service.[^110] Many
of the tools used for the elaboration and analysis of quantitative data
(eg. Excel, Python, R, Stata) can be used to generate aggregate
statistical observations from qualitative data. The analysis of
restricted personal data may require scholars to work in a 'safe-room'
environment. If this is required by a data provider, contact the
Library.[^111]

[8.c Research data management and data management plans for qualitative
data]{.underline}

Although research data management for qualitative data is similar to
research data management for quantitative data (Section 5 above) - there
are some additional considerations. Scholars completing data management
plans should describe how unique qualitative data materials (eg. primary
sources) will be handled and secured. Due to the heterogeneous,
multi-media and complex nature of qualitative data in the humanities and
social sciences, it is particularly important for scholars to keep a
complete and accurate record of all data sources, and to preserve
notebooks, questionnaires, codebooks and multilingual thesauri.
Supporting documentation serves as the basis for accurate metadata, and
facilitates future retrieval and reuse. In the case of non-repeatable,
time-sensitive, socio-political research, data management plans should
describe the qualitative research methods used.

[8.d Metadata for qualitative data]{.underline}

The metadata schema used for quantitative data outputs (6.c above) can
also be used for qualitative data outputs, with some additional
considerations. As well as the name(s) of scholars and technical
collaborators who generate the research dataset, it may be necessary to
acknowledge the authors/creators of pre-existing subsidiary resources.
Multi-lingual documentation should be provided where relevant. The
format and version of software used to elaborate the data should also be
indicated. The Oral History Association (OHA) maintains an online Manual
of Best Practices providing guidance on metadata and description.[^112]
The Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA)
provides guidelines for data management in the social sciences.[^113]

[8.e Qualitative data archiving, preservation and access]{.underline}

From 2023, the EUI Library and the Historical Archives of the European
Union provide support for the archiving and preservation of qualitative
data, multi-media, transcripts and ancillary research outputs.
Audio-visual and other qualitative data, transcripts and ancillary
materials can be securely archived at the HAEU as follows.

-   Fill in the online submission form[^114]

-   Upon receipt of the form, EUI Library staff (resdata@eui.eu) will
    contact the submitter, with a link to a safe online folder
    (SharePoint) to transfer the data. The SharePoint folder can only be
    accessed by Library and HAEU staff directly involved with the
    process of data repositing

-   The submitter will also receive more detailed information on how to
    structure the folder and how to provide metadata.

-   The submitter will be contacted again by resdata@eui.eu when the
    repositing of the dataset has been completed. The data will be
    permanently deleted from the temporary folder on SharePoint.

Qualitative data presented for preservation must be accompanied by
documentation describing the resource and, where applicable, indices or
codebooks describing the material.

**9. EUI INFRASTRUCTURE, SOFTWARE, PROTOCOLS AND SUPPORT**
