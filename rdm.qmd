# Research Data Management {.unnumbered}

Data should be carefully managed throughout the duration of the research project. Particular attention should be given to data input, quality control, dataset design, data protection, data security and backup during the project. At an early stage, scholars should define
dataset structure, file structure and variable naming. Documentation and codebooks should be updated throughout the research project.
