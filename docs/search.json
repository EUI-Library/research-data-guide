Two prominent ones include: * Under the FAIR Cookbook, several resources are offering guidance and assistance in FAIR data management. The FAIR Cookbook is designed to serve a variety of audience types and involved in different stages of data management life cycle. The FAIR Cookbook is developed and maintained by life sciences professionals, both in the academia and industry sectors, including members of the ELIXIR community. * Under ELIXIR Research Data Management Kit (RDMkit), resources are provided for life scientists to guide them in better management of their research data in adhering to the FAIR Principles. It is an attempt to help researchers work at different capacities, both in individual and collaborative workspaces. The RDMkit is open for suggestions from anyone, as long as they abide by the contributor responsibilities.\nMany groups and organisations are working to define guidance and tools to help researchers and other stakeholders (like librarians, funders, publishers, and trainers) make data more FAIR. There are two global initiatives that act as umbrella organisations and reference points for many discipline-specific efforts, including the ones listed above: GOFAIR and the Research Data Alliance (RDA). * Under GOFAIR, there are many Implementation Networks (INs) committed to implementing the FAIR principles. * Under the RDA, there are several groups tackling different aspects relevant to the RDM life cycle. Among these, one group, the FAIR Data Maturity Model Working Group is reviewing existing efforts, building on them to define a standard set of common assessment criteria for the evaluation of FAIRness.",

    "text": "FAIR principles in DMPs\nMost funding programmes, including ERC and other Horizon Europe schemes, have embraced the principles and practices of Open Science, fostering the approach that data should always be “as open as possible and as closed as necessary”.\nThe FAIR principles have been adopted as a guiding rubric in DMPs to ensure that research data are effectively Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The FAIR principles also shaped the most recent version of the DMP templates for ERC and Horizon Europe.\nHere following a few elements that Principal Investigators and Project Managers have to consider when addressing the FAIR principles in their DMP:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking data Findable\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the repository where data outputs will be preserved and, where possible, made openly available; eg. the EUI research\nrepository, Cadmus.\nDescribe how folders, files, variables and versions will be\nconsistently named to aid discovery\nDatasets should be assigned accurate and consistent metadata to\naid findability and machine-retrievability (Section 6.c)\nDatasets should have persistent, unique digital object\nidentifiers (eg. handles generated by the EUI research\nrepository, Cadmus).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking data Accessible\n\n\n\n\nDistinguish between in-project data which will remain closed (or will be destroyed) after the project; and data outputs which will be preserved and (where possible) openly shared after the project\nFor restricted data, give reasons for restricted status (eg.\npersonal data protection and/or database copyright compliance)\nFor restricted data the terms and conditions for access should be explicitly stated (even if these might be revised as the research progresses)\nFor sharable data, the status ‘open’ (accessible immediately) or ‘embargoed’ (accessible at a later date) should be assigned\nDescribe data protection and anonymisation measures in detail\nDescribe the software packages/tools required to use the data\nMetadata records are indexed in the EUI research repository,\nCadmus, which provides machine-readable metadata for indexing by search engines and application programming interfaces (eg. Google Scholar, OpenAIRE and CORE).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking data Interoperable\n\n\n\n\nProvide details of any standard controlled vocabularies (ontologies, thesauri and taxonomies) from the relevant discipline (social sciences, humanities, ethnography &c.)\nVariable schemas should be readable by standard software packages to facilitate data interoperability\nStandard metadata and naming conventions should be used\nThe EUI research repository, Cadmus, uses web standards (the underlying DSpace software adopts standards for embedded micro-data and the OAI-PMH interoperability protocol) providing both human- and machine-readable interfaces to search, discover and access reposited data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking data Reusable\n\n\n\n\nOpen data generated by the research project should be made available under an open licence that clearly states reuse conditions - either the Creative Commons Attribution International license: CC-BY International[^49] or the Creative Commons Public Domain Universal license: CC0\nSupporting documentation and codebooks (PDF/A documents and ‘readme.txt’ files) should be reposited with the data to make the observations comprehensible and reusable by other scholars and stakeholders\nProvide information about any tools or instruments necessary to reuse or verify the data (software, algorithms, routines, models &c.)\nNote any data embargo period, where applicable.",

They can be accessed from Service laptops or personally-owned computers too and are backup regularly.\nMicrosoft OneDrive for Business: OneDrive for Business is EUI’s corporate cloud storage and is part of Microsoft’s Office 365 family. It is a valid alternative to one’s personal G: drive as it allows easy access anytime, anywhere (including on mobile devices) via free app or directly online via web.\nMicrosoft SharePoint: Microsoft SharePoint is the corporate, cloud-based sharing platform included in the Office 365 suite. It allows for efficient file sharing amongst EUI members as well as external collaborators and is therefore ideal for a mixed community found for example in research projects.\nMicrosoft Teams: Microsoft Teams is a powerful, cloud-based all-in-one collaboration and communication tool, part of Microsoft Office 365. Participants in a Team can be either EUI members only or a mix of EUI members and external users, with the idea that all share the same (access) rights. Amongst a wide range of collaboration tools (chat, meetings, desktop sharing, third-party apps, etc.), Teams offers a file storage (and sharing) platform which is based on SharePoint (see above) for easy integration with existing SharePoint sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWe strongly advise to adopt more than one solution at the same time, following 3-2-1 backup rule\n\n\nmaintains a strong password policy to prevent the loss, exposure, or corruption of sensitive information.[^77] The ICT Service advises that the personal G:\\ network drive “should always be used to store work-related data.”[^78] The drive is backed up by the ICT Service. Full details about EUI drive quotas are provided by the ICT Service.[^79] (EUI members also have a personal C:\\ drive for storing non-work related data (photos &c.) which is not backed up.) The EUI protects computing devices by applying patches, and computers are protected by anti-malware solutions which are updated regularly to prevent malware infections.",

The processing of sensitive data relating to health, racial/ethnic origin, religious beliefs, political opinions, genetic/biometric observations, sexual orientation, memberships &c. may require EUI Ethics Committee clearance before data collection and processing begins.[^106] Ethics Committee approval cannot be sought retroactively. The Ethics Committee review can take up to six weeks. Principal investigators should consult the online Initial Checklist and the supporting documentation on the EUI information page for Ethics and Integrity in Academic Research.[^107] When collecting, processing, using and storing personal data, scholars are responsible for obtaining and documenting the informed consent of subjects. The EUI sample consent form can be used.[^108] Throughout the research data lifecycle, scholars are responsible for preserving the confidentiality of data observations pertaining to human subjects, families and households. Anonymisation and pseudonymisation techniques are described at Section 2.d above. Software such as the open source QualiAnon anonymisation tool can be used for the anonymisation and redaction of interview transcripts.[^109]\nScholars who intend to generate images, videos or photocopies of materials and objects in museums and archives, should seek the rights owners’ permission in advance.
