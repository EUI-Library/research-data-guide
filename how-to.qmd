## Structure of the guide
The **EUI Research Data Guide** is intended as a reference resource (i.e. not intended to be read linearly, beginning to the end) but all chapters link to one another to provide a comprehensive perspective on the data services and support provided by the EUI.

Its structure follows the [Research Data Lifecycle](rdm-lifecycle.qmd) in an attempt to cover core aspects of data discovery, management, analysis and sharing.

## What to expect in each chapter

Each chapter of the **EUI Research Data Guide** provides guidance on a specific aspect or stage in the Research Data Lifecycle and is organized as follows:

- Explicit **learning outcomes**
- A general description and **introduction** of each aspect/stage.
- A list of the **main considerations** that need to be taken into account during each stage.
- Tips and **practical guidance** on the specific topic
- Direct linking to **available EUI resources, tools, and support**
- Selected **open resources** to support additional and more in-depth self-paced training
